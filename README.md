🌉 Skill Bridge
Skill Bridge is an AI-powered platform designed to help students, graduates, and young professionals bridge the gap between learning and earning.

It connects users to real-world opportunities — internships, mentorships, and projects — that build skills, validate experience, and open doors to employment.

Built for the Hedera Africa Hackathon, Skill Bridge combines AI intelligence and Hedera blockchain technology to create transparency, trust, and verifiable achievements for every user.

🤔 Problem Statement

Across Africa, thousands of students graduate every year without access to the kind of practical experience employers demand. At the same time, companies struggle to find skilled, job-ready candidates they can trust.

The result is a wide and persistent skills gap between education and employment.

✨ Our Solution

Skill Bridge makes it easier for learners and employers to connect meaningfully through a decentralized, skill-based ecosystem.

Here’s how:

    Opportunity Hub: Students and graduates can find verified internships, gigs, and mentorship programs.

    Blockchain Validation: Employers and mentors can validate completed work through Hedera’s blockchain.

    AI Matching: The AI system matches users to the most relevant opportunities based on their profile and goals.

    Verified Achievements: Users earn digital skill badges and verified certificates stored on the blockchain as proof of their growth.

🚀 Key Features

    AI-Powered Matching: Personalized opportunity recommendations based on skills and interests.

    Blockchain Verification: Every achievement and project completion is recorded on Hedera for transparency.

    Skill Badges & Certificates: Earn digital badges and build a credible on-chain profile.

    Opportunity Hub: A single space where learners, mentors, and companies connect and collaborate.

    Smart Reward System: Automated incentives for verified milestones and completed tasks.
